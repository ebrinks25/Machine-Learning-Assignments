    "# Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can store and manipulate data,\n",
    "let us briefly review the subset of basic linear algebra\n",
    "that you will need to understand and implement\n",
    "most of models covered in this course.\n",
    "Below, we introduce the basic mathematical objects, arithmetic,\n",
    "and operations in linear algebra,\n",
    "expressing each of them through mathematical notation\n",
    "and the corresponding implementation in code. Resource: Zhang, Aston, et al. \"Dive into deep learning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never studied linear algebra or machine learning,\n",
    "then your past experience with math probably consisted\n",
    "of thinking about one number at a time.\n",
    "And, if you ever balanced a checkbook\n",
    "or even paid for dinner at a restaurant\n",
    "then you already know how to do basic things\n",
    "like adding and multiplying pairs of numbers.\n",
    "For example, the temperature in Palo Alto is $52$ degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "Formally, we call values consisting\n",
    "of just one numerical quantity *scalars*.\n",
    "If you wanted to convert this value to Celsius\n",
    "(the metric system's more sensible temperature scale),\n",
    "you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f$ to $52$.\n",
    "In this equation, each of the terms---$5$, $9$, and $32$---are scalar values.\n",
    "The placeholders $c$ and $f$ are called *variables*\n",
    "and they represent unknown scalar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we adopt the mathematical notation\n",
    "where scalar variables are denoted\n",
    "by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, and $z$).\n",
    "We denote the space of all (continuous) *real-valued* scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "For expedience, we will punt on rigorous definitions\n",
    "of what precisely *space* is,\n",
    "but just remember for now that the expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar.\n",
    "The symbol $\\in$ can be pronounced \"in\"\n",
    "and simply denotes membership in a set.\n",
    "Analogously, we could write $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "to state that $x$ and $y$ are numbers\n",
    "whose value can only be $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**A scalar is represented by a tensor with just one element.**)\n",
    "In the next snippet, we instantiate two scalars\n",
    "and perform some familiar arithmetic operations with them,\n",
    "namely addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n"

    ":label:`subsec_lin-algebra-norms`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most useful operators in linear algebra are *norms*.\n",
    "Informally, the norm of a vector tells us how *big* a vector is.\n",
    "The notion of *size* under consideration here\n",
    "concerns not dimensionality\n",
    "but rather the magnitude of the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, a vector norm is a function $f$ that maps a vector\n",
    "to a scalar, satisfying a handful of properties.\n",
    "Given any vector $\\mathbf{x}$,\n",
    "the first property says\n",
    "that if we scale all the elements of a vector\n",
    "by a constant factor $\\alpha$,\n",
    "its norm also scales by the *absolute value*\n",
    "of the same constant factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\alpha \\mathbf{x}) = |\\alpha| f(\\mathbf{x}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second property is the familiar triangle inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) \\leq f(\\mathbf{x}) + f(\\mathbf{y}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The third property simply says that the norm must be non-negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That makes sense, as in most contexts the smallest *size* for anything is 0.\n",
    "The final property requires that the smallest norm is achieved and only achieved\n",
    "by a vector consisting of all zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall i, [\\mathbf{x}]_i = 0 \\Leftrightarrow f(\\mathbf{x})=0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that norms sound a lot like measures of distance.\n",
    "And if you remember Euclidean distances\n",
    "(think Pythagoras' theorem) from grade school,\n",
    "then the concepts of non-negativity and the triangle inequality might ring a bell.\n",
    "In fact, the Euclidean distance is a norm:\n",
    "specifically it is the $L_2$ norm.\n",
    "Suppose that the elements in the $n$-dimensional vector\n",
    "$\\mathbf{x}$ are $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
